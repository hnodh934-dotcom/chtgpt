# IPLocatorApp

This is a very small SwiftUI example that fetches IP geolocation information using `ip-api.com`.

## Building

1. Open the folder in Xcode (`File` -> `Open` -> select `IPLocatorApp` directory).
2. Build and run on an iOS device or simulator.

The app displays your current IP address and location when you tap the **Fetch IP Info** button.
